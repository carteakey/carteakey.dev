Excerpt from a 4070 Review

Even though I could buy the 9-series of whatever PC part - 4090, 7950, i9 whatever - there's a part of me that's too stubborn to do so, and I make my fun shopping in the upper midrange. It's served me very well, with the rare if defensible miss of buying a 3080 12GB for $1k. (It was as stock levels were coming back, but it wasn't clear if it was a surge or a trend yet, so I moved on it.)

Nothing wrong with the card and probably the only thing that could drive my AW34 in a sensible way, but I do feel a small pang of superannuated buyer's remorse. The fun is in the 2nd and 3rd SKU down. It's just more fun to weigh and read and agonize and then build - it's cheerful, I guess, rather than akin handling Faberge eggs. It kind of mentally keeps them in check as a hobby, a luxury, and to an extent a commodity.
