Gemini's Nano-banana is literally nuts. I'm surprised that it exists and we're so normalized to have such tools that are borderline magic.

I recently got an idea of using it to restore old/damaged photos of my family. I called it "Personal Braumgartner Restoration" because of the channel [Braumgartner Restoration](https://www.youtube.com/@BaumgartnerRestoration) on YouTube, who does amazing restorations of old paintings.

Here is one of my photos of my grandfather, taken in the 1950s.

{% image_cc "./src/static/img/grandpa_before.jpg", "", "w-3/4", "Original old photo of my grandfather" %}

And here is the result after using Nano-banana:

{%image_cc "./src/static/img/grandpa_after.png" ,"" ,"w-3/4", "Restored photo of my grandfather" %}

Pretty amazing, right?

The prompt I used was:
```md
Bring back to life this old picture I took. 
I want it now to have natural daylight colors, as naturally as you can. 
Make it seem like an iPhone took the picture. 
And turn it into a photo instead of a photo of a photo.
Don't change any elements in the photo itself. 
Be as accurate as possible to the source material
```

Here's another one of my family's photos, taken in the 1970s.

{%image_cc "./src/static/img/family_before.jpg",  "", "w-3/4","Original old photo of my family"  %}

And here is the result after using Nano-banana:

{%image_cc "./src/static/img/family_after.png"  , "", "w-3/4","Restored photo of my family"  %}

The uncanny effect is still there, but it looks incredible nonetheless.
