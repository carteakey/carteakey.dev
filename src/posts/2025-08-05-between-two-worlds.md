Taking a break from tech posts to share something more personal... Following is the icebreaker speech I gave at my local Toastmasters group.

When I first landed in Canada from India in 2023, I had two bags, a head full of dreams, and no idea that winter coats come in different thicknesses. I walked out of Pearson airport in my "warmest" jacket from Delhi in November and by the time I reached the taxi, I was convinced I'd made a life-altering mistake.

Welcome to the beautifully complicated life of a first-generation immigrant.

## The Canada I Imagined vs. Reality

Growing up, Canada existed in my mind as this magical place—clean streets, gentle snowfalls, and people who said "sorry" for no reason. The reality? Snow piles high enough to hide cars, streets sometimes so quiet you can hear your own footsteps, and yes, people do say "sorry"—mostly when you're in their way.

The silence hit me first. I found myself missing the beautiful chaos of India: street vendors calling out, neighbors dropping by unannounced, cricket matches blaring from every TV. Here, everything felt too quiet. Almost lonely.

## Learning the Unwritten Rules

Beyond snowstorms and silence, my first real Canadian test happened at Tim Hortons. I stood there, completely lost, discovering that a "double-double" wasn't just coffee—it was my initiation into Canadian culture.

That same week, I spent ten minutes in the grocery store hunting for coriander, only to discover Canadians call it cilantro. (And don't get me started on how paneer suddenly became a luxury item here.) Small things, but they add up when you're trying to figure out where you belong.

## Finding My Rhythm

Slowly, though, I found my pace. I learned to cook familiar dishes with Canadian ingredients. I discovered hiking trails that gave me a peace no crowded city ever could. And I built friendships with people who didn't just welcome me—they taught me how to pronounce "Toronto" the Canadian way. (It's "Trawno," by the way.)

## The Identity Challenge

The moment that crystallized everything happened at my first office holiday party. People were sharing their Christmas traditions, and when they asked about mine, I froze. Do I explain Diwali and risk being the "different" one, or just nod along about gingerbread cookies?

I chose honesty. I told them about lighting diyas, about Diwali being our festival of lights, about the firecrackers and celebrations. Their response surprised me—they were genuinely interested. They asked questions, shared their own family traditions. Later that night, when I called my family, they teased me about my emerging Canadian accent, laughing about how I was "losing touch."

That's when I realized belonging isn't about fitting into someone else's box. It's about having the courage to bring your own story to the table, even when you're caught between worlds that both claim you and question your authenticity.

## The Ongoing Dance

Here's what I've learned: being a first-generation immigrant means living in a constant dance between two worlds. At home, my parents passionately present PowerPoint slides of potential arranged marriage matches while I argue for dating someone I've actually met. An hour later, I'm at work discussing weekend plans and marveling at conversations about work-life balance—something my Indian upbringing hadn't quite prepared me for.

When I visit India now, the exciting chaos that I once missed feels overwhelming. When I return to Canada, the quiet streets don't feel like home, I still miss that vibrant life of India. This dance between cultures isn't confusion—it's richness (probably).

## What I've Gained

Living between two worlds has taught me resilience, perspective, and that cultures don't have to compete—they can complement each other beautifully.

So if you see me this winter, properly layered in a truly thick Canadian coat, with warm gulab jamun in one hand and a Tim Hortons coffee in the other, that's not someone caught between worlds. That's someone who's learned to celebrate living fully in both—my own personal celebration of cultures.

Because it isn't about choosing sides. It's about embracing the privilege of calling two places home.
