**Warning:** Borderline shitpost.

Is there a thing as a favorite meme? Well i have one - its the "IQ Bell Curve Meme" - which unlike the name suggests, has nothing to do with IQ or intelligence. The X-axis represents any situation or concept that can progress from ignorance to knowledge back to ignorance, and the idea that simpler systems or explanations are often better, also known as the principle of Occam's Razor. One's pursuit of knowledge takes them from left to right - and then, the cycle repeats. (obviously there is more nuance to it).

Some examples..

**On Note-taking systems**

**On data tools**
