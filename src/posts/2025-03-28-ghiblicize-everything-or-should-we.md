With all respect to the incredible talent and creativity at Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki, I genuinely can’t stop myself from using ‘convert to ghibli’ — or as everyone now calls it, ‘ghiblify’ — on every image I see can see after the recent 4o image generation updates. At least, until it inevitably stops (perhaps rightly). It feels too good to merely call it inspiration.

We are witnessing something extraordinary: computational power effortlessly creating art of pixel-perfect precision—art that traditionally demands years, if not lifetimes, of meticulous effort, devotion, and passion. On one hand, this is perhaps the most astonishing computational achievement I've witnessed. On the other hand, it brings forth profound ethical and philosophical questions.

Does the ease of generating something with a prompt undermine the countless hours, blood, sweat, and tears artists invest into mastering their craft? Or does it open a new frontier where artistic expression becomes more accessible and democratized? Does the very fact that anything can be turned into an artstyle that was very restricted in its quantity due to the artistic barriers - lessen the authenticity and makes us more "bored" of it?

Two truths can co-exist, and this case - seem to be very conflicting.
