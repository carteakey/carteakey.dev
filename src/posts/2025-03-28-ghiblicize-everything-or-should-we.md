With all respect to the talent, hardwork and creativity at *Studio Ghibli* and Miyazaki, i can't stop doing "convert to ghibli, or i'd like to call it - ghiblicize everything my eyes can see after the recent image generation updates. Atleast before it all stops - maybe rightfully so. It feels too good now to call it just inspiration.

We are witnessing something extraordinary: computational power effortlessly creating art of pixel-perfect precisionâ€”art that traditionally demands years, if not lifetimes, of meticulous effort, devotion, and passion. On one hand, this is perhaps the most astonishing computational achievement I've witnessed. On the other hand, it brings forth profound ethical and philosophical questions.

Does the ease of generating something with a prompt undermine the countless hours, blood, sweat, and tears artists invest into mastering their craft? Or does it open a new frontier where artistic expression becomes more accessible and democratized? Does the very fact that anything can be turned into an artstyle that was very restricted in its quantity due to the artistic barriers - lessen the authenticity and makes us more "bored" of it?

Two truths can co-exist, and this case - seem to be very conflicting.
