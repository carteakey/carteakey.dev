**Note:** Writing unfiltered, raw and undeveloped thoughts. Lack of knowledge and experience may be more visible than usual.\

The year is 2023, GPT-4 has been launched. The world has suddenly gained interest in it's programming and generalization capabilities.  You, as a techie, try it to generate some code. It performs the basic tasks just fine. You look 1 layer deep and ask more contextual questions, it starts to fall apart like cotton. You take a big sigh, your job is safe! You still find utility in the tool, and ask it to generate boilerplate code, ideas for solutions. You still have to understand what the code means line by line and have to be really careful taking that output into your codebase, as it often makes mistakes. Your learning isn't affected, rather your debugging skills are improved!\

Cut to 2026, you ask one of your 347 CLI / IDE agents to do all your coding for you, and more often than not, blindly paste the results (you don't even need to paste, as it edits your codebase directly) and more often than not, it just works. You feel happy and lazy, yet scared at the same time. You could get used to this. You are getting used to this. Intelligence is available on-tap and thinking becomes a chore. 

Yet, a disease starts to spread. Unless you've been holding the fort, being very careful in merging those PRs or only using it for non-essential work. The disease is **gradient descent**. Your code and your end product had character, it was a product of you and of many others' ***[idiosyncrasies](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&client=safari&hs=zWfU&sca_esv=c7a34cb64741ffad&rls=en&biw=1470&bih=742&sxsrf=ANbL-n5gdVJRz_iSQtpr7S2gSD7jUdd5tg:1770861217728&q=idiosyncrasies&spell=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi44dCO7NKSAxXglYkEHUpUNqEQkeECKAB6BAgNEAE)***. Evolution, culture and an individual life had caused each one of you to think differently, interpret differently and when a bunch of such different people came together, there was magic. Think of it as art - something happens when Roger Waters and David Gilmour — two people who saw the world completely differently, who frustrated each other, who occasionally couldn't stand each other — made music together. Something happens when you take a bunch of wetware that all thinks differently. A direction is formed, a culture is formed. A product / dare i say even code has personality.

That core starts to rot, everything is now the product of "**the average", the default, the feeling of slop, the feeling of everyone trying to do everything. Its the perfect code, yet it's not, something is missing.** Everyone is pulling from the same latent space. You can almost smell/taste it. **There's no sense of architecture. Maybe the quirks &** culture are being eroded. Does every line of code in a software product contribute to the end result. I'd say absolutely. Its like how every cell in your body forms what is you.

I am not a software dev, but i can still feel it.

Yet there's always hope. Hope that some hold the fort, hold their craft dear. The ones who will be akin to craftsman in the future, their work shall be valued, but there will be much lesser of them around.

Until then, do not go gentle into that good night. *Document your idiosyncrasies*. The weird decisions, the conflicts, ramblings. Dont give away to the gradient descent.
