Its interesting how i've replaced all my social media activity, bit by bit with my own site. Be it microposts, photos, or even small notes, its all here, within my very own site.

I know no one reads it, but as some wise person once said - "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?" - well, if I write something on my own site, and no one reads it, does it matter? To me, yes. It does.
