    <h1>Now</h1>

    <p>This is my now page, inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">nownownow.com</a>.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>I got a bike! (or what the reddit community calls a Bike Shaped Object). For some reason i find it more exciting than getting a car.</li>
    </ul>

    {% image "./src/static/img/bike.jpeg", "My new bike" %}

    <ul>
        <li>Had the pleasure to be back at my alma mater TMU as a guest speaker.</li>
        <li>Finally playing Doom Eternal. Rip and tear!</li>
        <li>Trying to setup an agent to find meetup events in my area and register for the ones I like.</li>
        <li>Gonna turn 28 in a few days, and as my friend said "Your subscription free body maintenance ends soon".</li>
        <li>Listening to "Disintegration" by The Cure, and "Hail to the Thief" by Radiohead.</li>
    </ul>
