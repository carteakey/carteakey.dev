<h1>About</h1>
Hi 👋🏼, Thanks for dropping by!

My name's Kartikey. Most people pronounce it as **_carteakey_** - hence the [site](https://carteakey.dev).

## Work
I'm a Data Engineer (sort of) currently living in Toronto.

Most of my experience has been with clients in **Supply Chain** & **Banking**, where I helped develop applications and automating stuff (the boring one, of course).

You can find more about my work history on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kartikeychauhan).

## Interests 

I’ve recently discovered my passion in Data Science and Machine Learning, and often try to work on related [projects](https://github.com/carteakey). 

Gaming is one of the many ways I like to spend my free time. I am a huge Soulsborne fan, and love reading about intricate lore and mythical stuff (looking at you, Bloodborne).

### So, Yeah… That’s Me!
Feel free to [contact](mailto:kartikeychauhan27@gmail.com) me if you want to connect.
