<h1>About</h1>
Hi 👋🏼, Thanks for dropping by!

My name's Kartikey. Most people pronounce it as **_carteakey_** - hence the [site](https://carteakey.dev).

{% set fact = randomFacts | random %}
Here's a random fact about me: <span class="">"{{ fact }}"</span>


## Work
I'm a Data Analyst currently living in Toronto. You can find more about my work history on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kartikeychauhan).

{# My experience has been mostly with clients in **Supply Chain** & **Banking**, where I helped develop data-driven solutions and automating stuff (the boring one, of course). #}

## Interests 

I’ve discovered my passion in Data Science and Machine Learning, and often try to work on related [projects](https://github.com/carteakey). 

Gaming is one of the many ways I like to spend my free time. I am a huge Soulsborne fan, and love reading about intricate lore and mythical stuff (looking at you, Bloodborne).



## So, Yeah… That’s Me!
Feel free to contact me kartychauhan[at]gmail[dot]com if you want to connect.
