<h1>About</h1>

Hi 👋🏼, I'm **Kartikey** (most people say _carteakey_ - hence the domain).

Data Analyst in Toronto. I wrangle data by day and tinker with self-hosted servers, local LLMs, and side projects by night. The professional version of me is on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kartikeychauhan).

{% set fact = randomFacts | random %}
**Random fact:** _"{{ fact }}"_

## Work

I'm currently a Senior Data Analyst at McAfee, working on product analytics, retention, and revenue optimization. Previously, I've worked in enterprise risk at a Big 5 bank and supply chain analytics at an F500 manufacturer. These days I'm also into AI/ML and experimenting with what's possible when you run models locally. Check out my [projects](https://github.com/carteakey).

Here's a visual breakdown of [where my skills lie](/skills/) across the data landscape.

## Interests

**Gaming:** Massive Soulsborne fan. Bloodborne's lore lives rent-free in my head. I also dabble in retro gaming and emulation when the nostalgia hits.

**Movies:** Big on horror and sci-fi. The Thing (1982) is peak cinema and I will die on that hill. I can (and will) rewatch the Dark Knight trilogy at any time.

**Tech & Self-hosting:** I run a home server on a repurposed laptop and self-host everything I can. I believe in the indie web, RSS feeds, and ethical ads. This blog runs on the TEA stack (Tailwind, Eleventy, Alpine.js) and I've let AI agents loose on it - the commit history is wild.

**Organization:** I organize my life in Obsidian and call my vault "Vault 76" (yes, like Fallout). I've written about my [vault structure](/blog/2025-07-12-vault-76-my-obsidian-vault-structure) if you're into that sort of thing.

## Hobbies

**Expert:** Procrastination 🏆 · **Pretty Good:** Gaming, Movies · **Okay-ish:** Self-hosting · **Meh:** Fitness · **Know a Little:** Cycling, Audiophiling, Photography, Retro Gaming & Emulation, Hiking · **Barely Started:** Rock Climbing, Cover Music

**Wants to explore:** Flight Sims (MSFS), Game Dev (Unreal), Content Creation, Remastering old games, DVD Commentaries, Travelling, Reading

## Things I've Learned

- Never trust how you feel about your life past 9pm.
- Don't get confined by titles, Arjuna. Your duty is to do karma (solve problems).
- Will you do it if no one's watching?
- Social skills atrophy. Use them.
- We don't understand the truth, we just discover it.
