Hi üëãüèº, Thanks for dropping by!

My name's Kartikey. Most people pronounce it as **_carteakey_** - hence the [site](https://carteakey.dev) :| 
### Work
I'm a Software Consultant from India.

Much of my experience has been with clients in the **Supply Chain** & **Banking** industries, where I helped analyze, design & implement business applications.

My professional programming experience has been developing applications and automating stuff (the boring one, of course) in **Python**, **PL/SQL** & working with databases like **Oracle** & **Netezza**.

I won't bore you too much with my work history; that's what my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kartikeychauhan) is for.

### Passion

I‚Äôve recently discovered my passion in Data Science and Machine Learning, and I often try to work on some [projects](https://github.com/carteakey) in that area.

### Interests / Hobbies

Outside of work, I try to strike a balance between tinkering with tech and having fun.

I like to write about linux, data science, and other things I find interesting, on this blog.

Gaming is one of the many ways I like to spend my free time. I am a huge Soulsborne fan, and love reading about intricate lore and mythical stuff (looking at you, Bloodborne)

### So, Yeah‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs Me!

Feel free to [contact](mailto:kartikeychauhan27@gmail.com) me if you want to connect.
