# Now

This is my now page, inspired by [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about).

**Last updated:** Jun 22, 2025
- I got a bike! (or what the reddit community calls a Bike Shaped Object). For some reason i find it more exciting than getting a car.

- Had the pleasure to be back at my alma mater TMU as a guest speaker.
- Finally playing Doom Eternal. Rip and tear!
- Trying to setup an agent to find meetup events in my area and register for the ones I like.
- Gonna turn 28 in a few days, and as my friend said "Your subscription free body maintenance ends soon".
- Listening to "Disintegration" by The Cure, and "Hail to the Thief" by Radiohead.
