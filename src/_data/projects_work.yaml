    each open customer order in a specific interval.

    of an order failing to reach on time.
  - The matrix was developed through identifying patterns in past order data, classifying
    misses into 4 segments (Order, Ship, Delivery and Quantity).

    the business to monitor their customer serviceability percentage.
