Accessibility
These checks highlight opportunities to improve the accessibility of your web app. Only a subset of accessibility issues can be automatically detected so manual testing is also encouraged.
NAMES AND LABELS
Buttons do not have an accessible name
When a button doesn't have an accessible name, screen readers announce it as "button", making it unusable for users who rely on screen readers. Learn more.
Failing Elements
div.md:max-w-2xl > div.prose > nav.flex > button#toggleDarkMode
<button id="toggleDarkMode" class="self-center font-bold text-xs px-1 sm:px-3 sm:py-0 -mt-2 transition-all">
Form elements do not have associated labels
Labels ensure that form controls are announced properly by assistive technologies, like screen readers. Learn more.
Failing Elements
div.flex > div.flex > div.relative > input.absolute
<input type="range" min="0" :max="themes.length - 1" :value="currentIndex" @input="updateTheme(parseInt($event.target.value))" class="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full opacity-0 cursor-pointer" max="21">
Links do not have a discernible name
Link text (and alternate text for images, when used as links) that is discernible, unique, and focusable improves the navigation experience for screen reader users. Learn more.
Failing Elements
nav.flex > div.justify-between > span.transition-all > a.no-underline
<a class="no-underline hover:underline font-bold text-xl " href="/">
These are opportunities to improve the semantics of the controls in your application. This may enhance the experience for users of assistive technology, like a screen reader.
TABLES AND LISTS
Lists do not contain only <li> elements and script supporting elements (<script> and <template>).
Screen readers have a specific way of announcing lists. Ensuring proper list structure aids screen reader output. Learn more.
