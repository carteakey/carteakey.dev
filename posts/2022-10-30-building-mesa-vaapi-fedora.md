Fedora and openSUSE are [removing](https://linuxiac.com/fedora-and-opensuse-are-dropping-support-for-some-video-codecs/) H.264, H.265, and VC-1 VA-API video codecs support from Mesa to avoid potential patent issues.

## Why does it matter?

H26X's are currently the worldâ€™s most used HD video compression standards. Without Mesa supporting these codecs, any video playback will fallback to be CPU decoded, instead of GPU (which is inefficent, and may straight up not work on dated computers, and apps that heavily rely on video encoding / decoding.)

## Workaround / Fix

If you're on Fedora 37 Beta and have an AMD GPU, ne of the easiest ways to get x264 hardware accelerated encoding back would be to build Mesa drivers from source. Until we eventually get an [RPM Fusion](https://bugzilla.rpmfusion.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6426) package.

Mesa have an option to `-Dvideo-codecs=h264dec,h264enc,h265dec,h265enc,vc1dec` to do just that.

```bash
cd $HOME
sudo dnf install rpmdevtools
rpmdev-setuptree 	\\Create RPM build tree within user's home directory
```

Download Mesa Source and build dependencies

```bash
dnf download --source mesa \\Download the source rpm.
sudo dnf builddep mesa \\Install whatever is needed to build the given .src.rpm, .nosrc.rpm or .spec file.
rpm --install *.src.rpm \\Install the source rpm.
```

Add the missing `-Dvideo-codecs=h264dec,h264enc,h265dec,h265enc,vc1dec` to the mesa.spec file.

```bash
cd $HOME/rpmbuild/SPECS
sed -i '/^%meson \\/a \ \ -Dvideo-codecs=h264dec,h264enc,h265dec,h265enc,vc1dec \\' mesa.spec
```

Install the newly compiled rpms.

```bash
cd $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64
sudo dnf install *.rpm
```

Run `vainfo` to check whether the driver supports H264.

```bash
sudo dnf install libva-utils
vainfo
```

It should show something like this

{% image "./img/vainfo.png", "vainfo showing supported codecs" %}

While this may not be ideal, this should serve as a workaround until better solutions are in place.
